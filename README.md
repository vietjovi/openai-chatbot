# openai-chatbot

This repository contains a chatbot application that uses OpenAI's language model to generate responses to user queries. The chatbot is built using Python 3 and the OpenAI API, and it can be easily integrated into your web or mobile application.

## Setup

To get started with the OpenAI chatbot, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Create an account on the OpenAI website and obtain an API key.
- Set your API key in *config.py*.
- Start the chatbot by running ```python openai-chatbot.py ```.

Once the chatbot is up and running, you can start sending queries to it and it will respond with generated text based on the input.

## Usage

To use the OpenAI chatbot, simply send a query to the chatbot using the following format:

python openai-chatbot.py

>> Hello, can you help me with something?

The chatbot will generate a response based on the input and return it to you. You can continue the conversation by sending more queries, and the chatbot will generate responses to each one.

## Customization

The OpenAI chatbot can be easily customized to suit your specific needs. You can modify the chatbot's behavior by adjusting the parameters passed to the OpenAI API, or you can train your own language model using the OpenAI API and integrate it into the chatbot.
